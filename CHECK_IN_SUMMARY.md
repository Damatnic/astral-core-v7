## 🚨 Blockers & Decisions Needed

**No critical blockers at this time**

### Questions for Lead:

1. **Test Coverage Target**: Current setup targets 70% - is this acceptable?
2. **Logging Service**: Should we integrate with external logging service (e.g., Datadog, Sentry)?
3. **Type Migration**: Should we continue reducing `any` types in Phase 2, or prioritize other tasks?
4. **Documentation Format**: Prefer JSDoc or separate documentation files?

## 🎯 Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. Deploy linting agents to fix ESLint errors
2. Clean up unused code and imports
3. Apply consistent formatting
4. Begin comprehensive documentation
5. Target completion: 2-3 hours
